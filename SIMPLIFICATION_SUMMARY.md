# EC2 Patching Workflow Simplification - Changes Summary

## Overview
Successfully simplified the EC2 patching orchestration system by removing all approval-related components and workflows. The system now provides direct execution without manual approval gates, reducing complexity while maintaining the core patching functionality.

## Files Removed
- `lambda/SendApprovalRequest.py` - Lambda function for initiating approval workflow
- `lambda/ApprovalCallback.py` - Lambda function for processing approval responses 
- `lambda/ApprovalAuthorizer.py` - Lambda authorizer for API Gateway approval endpoints

## CloudFormation Template Changes
- **Removed Parameters:**
  - `ApprovalTimeoutSeconds`
  - `ApprovalEmail` 
  - `ApprovalSigningSecretString`

- **Removed Resources:**
  - `ApprovalTopic` (SNS topic for notifications)
  - `ApprovalAuditTable` (DynamoDB table for approval audit logs)
  - `ApprovalSigningSecret` (Secrets Manager secret for HMAC signing)
  - `SendApprovalRequestFunction` (Lambda function)
  - `ApprovalCallbackFunction` (Lambda function)
  - `ApprovalAuthorizerFunction` (Lambda function)
  - `ApprovalApi` (API Gateway HTTP API)
  - `ApprovalApiStage` (API Gateway stage)
  - `ApprovalApiRoutes` (API Gateway routes)
  - All related IAM roles and policies for approval workflow

- **Simplified Step Functions Definition:**
  - Changed `StartAt` from `ManualApproval` to `Waves`
  - Removed `ManualApproval`, `ApprovalNotification`, `ApprovalWait` states
  - Removed approval timeout and rejection handling states
  - Direct flow: Waves → PreWave → PerAccount → PerRegion → patching workflow

- **Updated CloudWatch Dashboard:**
  - Removed approval-related metrics and widgets
  - Focus on core Lambda functions only (PreEC2Inventory, SendSsmCommand, PollSsmCommand, PostEC2Verify)

## Documentation Updates
- **README.md:**
  - Removed references to "manual approval gates" from main description
  - Updated key components to remove approval gates
  - Removed approval-related Lambda functions from function list
  - Updated troubleshooting sections to remove approval callback references
  - Removed approval-related monitoring configuration

- **API Documentation (docs/api.md):**
  - Removed `SendApprovalRequest` function documentation
  - Removed `ApprovalCallback` function documentation

- **Troubleshooting Guide (docs/troubleshooting-guide.md):**
  - Removed "Approval or Callback Timeout" troubleshooting section
  - Removed approval-related Lambda function debugging commands

- **Architecture Diagrams (docs/diagrams/):**
  - Updated `generate_architecture.py` to remove approval flow cluster
  - Removed API Gateway, ApprovalAuthorizer, ApprovalCallback, and Rejected components
  - Regenerated `architecture.png` and `architecture.svg` without approval components

## Preserved Functionality
✅ **Core Patching Workflow:**
- Multi-account, multi-region orchestration
- Wave-based execution with configurable concurrency
- Pre-collection of system information (optional)
- SSM Run Command execution for patching
- Polling and monitoring of patch status
- Post-verification and issue detection
- S3 artifact storage with KMS encryption
- DynamoDB state tracking with TTL
- CloudWatch monitoring and dashboards

✅ **Security & Infrastructure:**
- KMS encryption for data at rest
- Cross-account IAM roles with external ID
- S3 bucket policies enforcing TLS
- DynamoDB point-in-time recovery
- Lambda reserved concurrency controls
- CloudWatch alarms and monitoring

## Result
The system is now significantly simplified while maintaining all core patching capabilities. Execution flows directly from orchestration to patching without approval gates, reducing operational overhead and complexity. The architecture remains production-ready with comprehensive monitoring, security controls, and multi-account support.

## Testing Required
1. Deploy the simplified CloudFormation template
2. Verify Step Functions execution flows directly to patching
3. Confirm all Lambda functions operate correctly
4. Validate CloudWatch dashboard displays relevant metrics only
5. Test end-to-end patching workflow in a dev environment
